# Pimp your Windows
## GlazeWM
Download [GlazeWM](https://github.com/lars-berger/GlazeWM/releases) as your [Tiling Window Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) and make sure the [symlink](https://github.com/BosEriko/nvim/blob/master/lua/config/nvim/settings/symlink.lua) script is working for it. Refer to its [configuration](https://github.com/lars-berger/GlazeWM#configuration) to know where the config file is located. Be sure to make it [automatically start](../automatically-start.md) on startup.
