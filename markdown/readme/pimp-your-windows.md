# Pimp your Windows
## GlazeWM
[GlazeWM](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=glazewm&s=0&d=1&o=true) should have been installed using the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) script that was run earlier on the instruction. Look where the executable of it was installed and create a shortcut for it somewhere on your file system. After creating the shortcut open the Properties of the schortcut itself and set `Shortcut` > `Run` to **Minimized**. Confirm that the [symlink](https://github.com/BosEriko/nvim/blob/master/lua/config/settings/symlink.lua) script is working for it. Be sure to make it [automatically start](../automatically-start.md) on startup.

## Wallpaper Engine
Download [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/) on Steam for your custom wallpaper and set it to open automatically on start up.
