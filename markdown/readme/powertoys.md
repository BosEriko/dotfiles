# PowerToys
[PowerToys](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=powertoys&s=0&d=1&o=true) should have been installed using the [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) script that was run earlier on the instruction. This will be used for PowerToys Run and Keyboard Manager. Set up Keyboard Manager with [these settings](../keyboard-manager.md).
