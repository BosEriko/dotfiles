# Dotfiles
Intended to be run on a fresh environment of OSX only.

## Installation

    # Open the default terminal and run the following
    xcode-select --install
    git clone https://github.com/BosEriko/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    sh ~/dotfiles/install.sh

## A few more steps
Open Karabiner-Elements and enable the following complex modifications:
- [Change caps_lock to control if pressed with other keys, to escape if pressed alone.](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_lock) - [Open JSON](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/json/caps_lock.json)
- Change right_command+hjkl to arrow keys

Close the default terminal and open Hyper or Visual Studio Code and that's it!

## Note
I also have some [Apps](markdown/apps.md) and [Games](markdown/games.md) that I frequently use.
