# Dotfiles
Intended to be run on a fresh environment of OSX only.

## Installation

    # Open the default terminal and run the following
    xcode-select --install
    git clone https://github.com/BosEriko/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh

## One last step
Close the default terminal and open Hyper and that's it!

## Note
I also have some [Apps](APPS.md) and [Games](GAMES.md) that I frequently use.
