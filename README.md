# Dotfiles
Intended to be run on a fresh environment of OSX only.

## Installation

    # Open the default terminal and run the following
    xcode-select --install
    git clone https://github.com/BosEriko/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
    ~/dotfiles/install.sh

## One last step
Close the default terminal and open Hyper and that's it!

## Other Apps
There are a couple of apps that I use almost all the time that are not automatically installed using the install script. They are the following:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/ph/download/mac/)
