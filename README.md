# Windows Dotfiles
This dotfiles is meant to be run on Windows 10 only.

## AutoHotkey
Download [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) current version and put both [Overload Capslock](ahk/overload-capslock.ahk) and [Hide Mouse When Typing](ahk/hide-mouse-when-typing.ahk) on the Desktop. Be sure to make them [automatically start](markdown/automatically-start.md) on startup.

**Note:** If you want to play games you can just suspend both the AutoHotkey script on the programs on the right side of the bottom Windows bar and then activate the scripts again on the Desktop when youâ€™re done playing games.

## bug.n
Download [bug.n](https://github.com/fuhsjr00/bug.n) for your [Tiling Window Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager). This uses [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) as well. Be sure to make them [automatically start](markdown/automatically-start.md) on startup, too.

## PowerToys
Download [PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) for PowerToys Run and Keyboard Manager. Set up Keyboard Manager with [these settings](markdown/keyboard-manager.md).

## Switcheroo
Download [Switcheroo](https://github.com/kvakulo/Switcheroo) and bind the hotkey to `Ctrl (Left)` `Space`. You also need to enable the following settings:
- Run on Startup
- Activate Switcheroo with `Alt` + `Tab`
- Automatically switch window when releasing `Alt` + `Tab`

## Nerd font
Download `FiraMono.zip` from the latest release of [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases) and install every font from the downloaded file.

## Ubuntu on WSL + Windows Terminal
[Turn on Developer Mode on the settings](markdown/enable-developer-mode.md) then install both [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) and [Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview). Restart your computer after the installation is complete then update Windows Terminal's [settings](windows-terminal/settings.json).

## Installation
Run this inside Ubuntu on WSL. Don't forget to change the proper location for the STORAGE env on the script below as well as inside [environment.z.sh](zsh/modules/environment.z.sh).
``` sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BosEriko/dotfiles-windows.git ~/.files
export STORAGE="/mnt/d" && ~/.files/install/entry.sh
```

## Visual Studio Code
Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [sign in using GitHub](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) to sync your settings. Your keyboard hotkeys can be found [here](https://boseriko-professional.notion.site/boseriko-professional/92045538d4be4360a6486d9d8d5178aa?v=ba96cfa3c35d4d7ca5c386d73c8c0a78). Visual Studio Code will be used when pair programming with someone to avoid confusion if they don't know [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

## Vieb
Download [Vieb](https://vieb.dev/) and update its [config](vieb/rc) file. It's usually on `%APPDATA%\Vieb\viebrc` but if you're unsure where the config file is located on windows you can run `:mkv full` inside Vieb and then take note of the message on the lower right of the Vieb window. You can check out your Vieb hotkeys [here](https://boseriko-professional.notion.site/boseriko-professional/92045538d4be4360a6486d9d8d5178aa?v=ccad9bd920524df8b66880da8b68cc35).

## Obsidian
Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to make use of the pulled obsidian folders from the installation script.

## Note
I also have some [apps](markdown/apps.md) and [games](markdown/games.md) that I frequently use and play along with the [equipment](markdown/equipment.md) of my choice.
